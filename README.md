## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

In this challenge I got to create a dropdown navigation menu, It was challenging but I was able to code something close to the design ðŸ˜…

### Continued development

In future projects I want to create a layout that is responsive without using many breakpoints, with flexbox and grid this is possible.
